# ChessGame
Chess game made with Java and Swing

## NOTE: This is a test build, these following core features are missing:
                                                   
1. En Passant
2. Draw (by insufficient material)
3. Draw (50 move rule)

## Intended features:

1. Notation log
2. Save and load position
3. Info tab
4. Timer

You can help test the game by moving the pieces, they should
move as intended and behave as they should considering the
missing features (Try as many impossible moves as possible!)
Move by selecting a square (highlighted yellow) then click
the destination.

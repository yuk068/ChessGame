# ChessGame
Chess game made with Java and Swing, you can run the program by either opening Chess.jar, opening run.vbs, or use java -jar

## Lore:
My second attempt at coding chess, this time i plan to create a full-fludge app, i plan to have all the core mechanics and features fine tuned and completed in v1. I also plan to do some research and maybe implement chess bot(s) for v2.
